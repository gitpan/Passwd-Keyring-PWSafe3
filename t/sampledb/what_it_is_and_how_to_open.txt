test.psafe3 is just some small Password Safe database created using
actual Password Safe GUI. Some tests start from (copy of) this base
to verify whether module properly reads it.

Password Safe GUI can be downloaded from http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/downloads.shtml

Master password for test.psafe3 is 
    10101010

Two perl scripts in this directory are illustrating use of Crypt::PwSafe3.
